# Project Overview:

# Data Description: 
The Telco Customer Churn dataset contains customer information such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status. The dataset consists of 7,043 customer records, including columns like customer ID, gender, monthly charges, contract type, tenure, payment method, tech support, phone service and churn status.

# Data Cleaning: 
The dataset was cleaned using Power query by addressing
missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types. Missing values
were handled using appropriate methods, duplicates were removed based on
customer ID, and data types were adjusted for columns with incorrect formats
and relevant columns were added to aid the analysis.

# Project Name: Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis

----
# Project Overview: 
This project aims to analyze customer churn in a Telco company using a dataset sourced from Kaggle.com. The analysis focuses on understanding the reasons behind customer churn and providing recommendations to mitigate it.


----
# Data Description: 
The Telco Customer Churn dataset contains customer information such as demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status. The dataset consists of 7,043 customer records, including columns like customer ID, gender, monthly charges, contract type, tenure, payment method, tech support, phone service and churn status.


---
# Data Cleaning: 
The dataset was cleaned using Power query by addressing
missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types. Missing values
were handled using appropriate methods, duplicates were removed based on
customer ID, and data types were adjusted for columns with incorrect formats
and relevant columns were added to aid the analysis.


----
# Descriptive Analysis: 
Descriptive statistics were computed for key variables
such as churn rate, average monthly charges, and tenure. Visualizations like
histograms, bar charts, and pie charts were created to represent the distribution
of variables like contract type, gender, and churn status (total churned â€“
percentage of churned males and females.)


----
# Results and Insights: 
The analysis revealed a churn rate of 26.54%, indicating
a significant challenge for the company. Customers with month-to-month
contracts and higher monthly charges exhibited a higher likelihood of churn.
Female customers were slightly more prone to churn. Churned customers had a
very short tenure period (0 to 10 months) compared to non-churned customers
while customers with very long periods churn less (8.93%). Those with no Tech
support tend to churn more with just 41.64%. For Internet service: Fiber Optic
churned higher with just 41.89%. Customers using electronic checks as a payment
method tend to churn more with 45.29%.

----
# Conclusion and Recommendations: 
Based on the analysis, recommendations
include focusing on customer retention strategies for a month-to-month contract
customers; the Month-to-month Contract Type should be given more attention as
customers that have subscribed for that contract tend to Churn. The need to
explore price or promotional offers for customers with high monthly charges and
addressing identified pain points through improved customer service to reduce
churn rates.
